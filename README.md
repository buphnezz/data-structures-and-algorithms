# Breadth-first

Reverse the order of multiple arrays.  Do not use any built in methods.

## Challenge

Write a function called breadthFirstTraversal which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach; print every visited node’s value.

- [x] Do all your work in a public repository called data-structures-and-algorithms
- [x] Create a branch in your repository called breadth-First-Traversal
- [x] On your branch, create a file called breadth-First-Traversal.js, with the proper file extension for your programming language
- [x] Include any language-specific configuration files required for this challenge to become an individual component, module, library, etc.
- [x] Write a function called breadthFirstTraversal which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach; print every visited node’s value.
- [x] Take a photo of your completed whiteboard, matching the example whiteboard layout.
- [x] Copy your photo into an /assets directory in your repo
- [x] Give the image file the same name as the branch you are working on
- [x] Embed the image in your README.md documentation
- [x] Create a pull request from your branch to your master branch
- [x] In your open pull request, leave as a comment a checklist of the specifications and tasks above, with the actual steps that you completed checked off
